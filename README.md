# hello-world2

Mostly this is about talking through the project logically with a plan. Not going on too long, focusing on the bits that work, clearly explaining concepts.

Explain the outcome, not what you did. You are trying to get buy in from various stakeholders and they only care about the outcome and commercial benefits, not the technical details of what you did.

What are the commercial benefits? How will your insights empower the business to improve / make changes that benefit the buisness.
If you have to explain something complex, simplify it - imagine you're talking to a family member or someone who has no idea what data science is


Tell the listener / presentee what you did, why and what the benefit is.
